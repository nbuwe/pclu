FIXED (in _chan.c) need to type "reset" after running pclu or any other pclu program:
echo is off and line feed is missing.

FIXED _job.c not supported => example-debug doesn't link...
	debugger seems ok, rebuild and restart seem to work.
	no major guarantees on _job.c as a whole, although the
	work done was only setting the masks for the sigactions:
	the clearing is definitely correct, the setting seems
	a little random (accurate per hex flags, but they didn't
	seem totally sensible)
