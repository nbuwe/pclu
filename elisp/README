This directory contains an Emacs CLU mode, CLU library documentation,
and software for accessing this documentation from within emacs.

Edit the definition of clu-lisp-directory in setup.el to point to the
directory where these emacs files will be installed (typically
$CLUHOME/elisp).  Then users can put the following line in their
~/.emacs file to access the CLU mode and documentation.

	(load-file "<location of setup.el file>/setup.el)
