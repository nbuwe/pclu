			   Portable CLU, Release 3.7
   		           -------------------------

			       November 30, 2016

0 Quick Start

   ~CLU is used to represent the CLU root directory.  Initially ~CLU is the
directory containing this release. 

   Installation: Set the CLUHOME shell variable to the name of the directory
containing this release.  Type "make" to build the compiler and its runtime
support.  Type "make install" to install the compiler.  See (2) below for more
details.

   Usage: See ~CLU/doc.

1 Notes

   CLU is no longer actively maintained.  This release updates Release 3.6
(March 17, 1992) to work under Linux on 64-bit machines.  It has been tested
under Debian 8.6.

   CLU is not licensed.  See ~CLU/COPYRIGHT for distribution information.

   If you have problems installing this release, or if you find bugs, please
send email to Dorothy Curtis at dcurtis.csail.mit.edu.

   The CLU Reference Manual is published by Springer-Verlag as a monograph, ISBN
0-387-91253-3 or ISBN 3-540-91253-3. Formerly it was in their Lecture Notes in
Computer Science series, Number 114.  The manual is also included as an appendix
to the book Abstraction and Specification in Program Development by Barbara
Liskov and John Guttag, published in 1986 by The MIT Press (ISBN 0-262-12112-3)
and McGraw-Hill (ISBN 0-07-037996-3).

   See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLU_(programming_language) for an
overview of CLU and links to websites containing distributions and further
documentation for CLU.

2 Installation

   There is some flexibility in where the CLU root directory can be
installed.  The possibilities (in the order searched) are

   1. the directory specified by the environment variable CLUHOME
   2. the home directory, as listed in /etc/passwd, of user name CLU
   3. /usr/local/lib/clu
   4. /usr/lib/clu
   5. /usr/clu

   Any such directory can, of course, be a symbolic link to the real directory.
In the file/directory names in this and other CLU documents, ~CLU is used to
represent the CLU root directory.  (In fact, this can be used within any CLU
program to refer to the root.)

   See ~CLU/Makefile for more  information.

   If you want the executables in ~CLU/exe to live elsewhere, move them or
edit ~CLU/Makefile, create the appropriate directory, and use "make install".

   The file howto.install contains some details of the make process which may be
interesting for ports to other platforms.
